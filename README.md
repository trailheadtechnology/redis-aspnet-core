# Cache Me If You Can: Supercharging .NET APIs with Caching
Talk by Jonathan "J." Tower

Are your .NET Web APIs crawling at a snail’s pace? Is your database groaning under the load of too many requests? If you’re nodding along, it might be time to turbocharge your APIs with a caching layer to transform your application’s performance.

In this session, we’ll look at APIs built with .NET and what can make them slow. I’ll show you what makes an endpoint a good candidate for caching, and show you how adding it can help alleviate performance problems. We’ll look at Redis and why it’s such a good option for your in-memory cache, and explore the new ASP.NET caching capabilities introduced in .NET 9 which provide enhanced performance and flexibility for your caching strategies. Finally, we’ll discuss some of the common pitfalls of caching implementations and explore the best tooling and libraries to help ease your caching implementation in .NET.

If you want to learn how to supercharge your .NET APIs with effective caching strategies, then make sure to attend this session!
